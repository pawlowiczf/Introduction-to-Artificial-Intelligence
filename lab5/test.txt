A route to a destination can be in one of two states: PASSIVE or
ACTIVE.  These states describe whether the route is guaranteed to be
both loop free and the shortest available (the PASSIVE state) or
whether such a guarantee cannot be given (the ACTIVE state).
Consequently, in PASSIVE state, the router does not perform any route
recalculation in coordination with its neighbors because no such
recalculation is needed.

In ACTIVE state, the router is actively involved in re-computing the
least-cost loop-free path in coordination with its neighbors.  The
state is reevaluated and possibly changed every time a topology
change is detected.  A topology change is any event that causes the
CD to the destination over any neighbor to be added, changed, or
removed from EIGRP's topology table.
